# R Part 1 June 15 

# Break out work:

## Break Out Group

#On your own, create a new R Project in a new directory. A directory is just a file folder. I recommend doing this in a file folder on your computer rather than in Google Drive, as sometimes working in Drive will give you repeated annoying warnings about access. Save this somewhere that will make sense for you and name it something that will make sense later, like LearningR. 

#Create a variable for a list of numbers 10 through 20, give it a name that makes sense to you, and find the median value. 






#Go to Mentimeter and give a thumbs up when done.
